<h1>Making a Flexible Strandbeest</h1>

<samp>Thu Sep 22 2022</samp>

<p>
  The <a href="https://www.strandbeest.com/">Strandbeests</a> are a family of kinetic
  sculptures developed by Theo Jansen. At their centre is a linkage which is responsible
  for their organic gait. The linkage is driven by a crank, and its end effector
  is a foot. It can be driven both fowards and backwards and at different speeds,
  making it analagous to a wheel. If several of them are arranged in tandem, and
  the cycles are syncopated using a crankshaft so that the feet do not leave the
  ground all at once, you have a sort of walking trolley that can either be powered
  at the crank, pulled along, or made to descend an incline under its own weight.
</p>
<p>
  I thought it would be possible to make the linkages out of a single piece of
  plastic, making use of flexures instead of joints. This comes with several
  advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I could easily 3D print complete sections of a Strandbeest</li>
  <li>
    Flexures do not need to be assembled, they do not need to be lubricated, nor
    do they wear out
  </li>
  <li>
    Flexures are less complex to model in CAD (though more complex to design)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>The difficulty of simulating large deflections</h2>
<p>
  Unfortuantely, flexures are significantly more mathematically complex than
  joints. I used Larry Howell’s <em>Compliant Mechanisms</em> almost exclusively,
  it is comprehensive and very readable.
</p>
<p>
  I won’t bore you with the theory, if you are interested I’ve detailed my
  adventures in simulating compliant mechanisms with multiple flexures <a
    href="theory">here</a
  > (spoiler: I didn’t get very far).
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, you can make a pretty good approximation of a flexure with linear
  springs and links, called the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM). They are
  explained in Chapter 5 of <em>Compliant Mechanisms</em>. The most obvious PRBM
  is to model a small flexure as a single torsional spring in the middle.

<p>
  In Fig. 1 we see three simple flexures operating in tandem with their PRBM
  equivalent. A has a very short flexure, so the PRBM is accurate through a
  large range of motion, B and C have much longer flexures, so the PRBMs are
  only accurate through a range of about 90 degrees. The value of a, used to
  determine the position of the pivot in B and C, is a empirically derived
  number.

<h2>Using FreeCAD to Design Linkages</h2>
<p>
  I tried several different rigid body solvers, but found them clumsy to use.
  You would have to define your model using code, or import it from some CAD
  package. I wanted something I could work on in realtime. I started using
  FreeCAD to sketch out ideas, using the contraint solver in the Sketcher
  workbench as a poor man’s rigid body solver. I found that FreeCAD worked fine
  for my use case (I wasn’t worryed about kinematics or dynamics at this point,
  I was looking for a mapping between crank angles and end effector position).
  FreeCAD has a python interface, so I wrote a script that would periodically
  change the angle of the input link.

  I could then change the lengths of links as I watched the linkage cycle,
  observing how the charactaristics of the path of the foot changed. Once I had
  something that more or less worked I wrote a second script that recorded the
  path of the foot as a set of coordinates, then changed the geometry of the
  foot, and repeated. When it had finished running I had a set of a hundred
  different paths, and I just had to select the best one. Now that I had my
  finished PRBM, I set about turning it into the compliant linkage it was
  supposed to be representing. I replaced all the joints with flexures and
  filled the spaces between with rigid bodies.

  I attempted to run a FEM analyis using CalculiX in Freecad, applying different
  displacements to try and replicate the effect of the crank turning. The
  results aren’t good, I suspect because the internal solver is linear. Notice
  how the pivot hole expands and contracts oddly.

<h2>The Printed Linkage</h2>
<p>
  I mirrored the linkage to make a part with two feet with one input and sent it
  off to a 3D printing service. I did have to reassure them that I wanted the
  flexures to be that thin, and that I would take the of risk them getting
  damaged in the post. Here is the final linkage in action:

<p>
  As you can see the parallel flexures buckle due to the torque on the foot from
  the link to the pivot. This is a limitation of using a PRBM, if I had found a
  better way of modelling the mechanism I might have been able to mitigate it.
  That being said it still works reasonably well. I never made a full
  Strandbeest using my mechanism, at this point I was completely sick of the
  project.
