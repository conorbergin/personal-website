    Sometime in 2020 I snapped the derailleur off my vintage road bike. Instead of just replacing the broken part I convinced myself that it would be cheaper to convert the drivetrain to a single speed fixed gear. This turned out to be woefully incorrect. I did end up with a real appreciation for the simplicity of working on old bikes.
