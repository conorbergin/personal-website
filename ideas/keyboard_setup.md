# Intro

For someone who writes and programs a lot my typing speed is shockingly low. Or, more accurately, I can't touch type. I can hunt and peck pretty quickly, but this doesn't help me on online touch typing tests. I also struggle to sight read music, so maybe I am not suited to this sort of multi-tasking.

One of the reasons I put off learning was I always felt the standard layout was a bit confused, not only because of QWERTY. The asymmetrical row stagger, the massive space bar, the modifier keys cramped in the corner.

So I end up with a split 36 key column staggered keyboard with a layout called Canary. I initially went with colmak-dh, but found myself dissatisfied with some awkward patterns. I did a bit more research and settled on Canary.
 
To be clear, my motivation is to made touch typing easier, if I could already do 120wpm on an ISO QWERTY keyboard, I wouldn't bother with any of this, but as I am starting with nothing I might as well go all in.
