# Interpreting language

When I was first learning to code, I was concerned with learning data structures and algorithms, how to split my code into functions and modules, how to write elegant business logic. I did not think to hard about what it means to run code.

# TeX

In TeX and its descendants the "Hello World" program is just that -- a text file with no commands will produce a pdf with the same text

# Perl

In perl every program is valid. 



# Errors

Errors are not a natural thing, you need to define them in order for them to exist. There are two sensible ways to handle errors in code: Exceptions and Monads. Returning "-1" is not a good way to express an error.
